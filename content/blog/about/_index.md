This blog is a place to put notes to self and general musings. Partly as a record of things I've found while digging into a topic, partly as a form of [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) to clarify my thoughts, and partly as a way to exorcise them from my head when, as is generally the case, they were a distraction from whatever I was supposed to be doing. They'll generally be byproducts of the learning process, and so aim to be informative rather than groundbreaking. Initially the subject matter will be mostly [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) just because I'm in the process of learning it, but who knows what else may creep in later.

## "Never Knowingly Undershaved"?

For anyone wondering about the name, it's a reference to [yak shaving](https://seths.blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that/) with a side allusion to a promotional slogan ("Never Knowingly Undersold") used by a UK retail chain. Yak shaving is very much going to be the theme here. I'm free now to pursue those temptingly hirsute bovines wherever they may roam, razor glinting keenly in the crisp clean air of the open steppe.

## Format

The format is going to be fairly minimalistic. I love the concept and values of the [quiet web](https://briankoberlein.com/tech/quiet-web/), and my ideal design for a webpage looks suspiciously like Reader View but with slightly more yaks. There will be absolutely no ads, trackers, analytics, cookies, or JavaScript. Anything that's not subject matter should stay out of the way as far as possible.

I do like HTML's newish `<details>` element as a way to capture optional digressions without breaking the flow of the main topic. I think of these as sub-yaks, fractally budding from the Great Universal Mandelyak.

## Credits

The header image had as its starting point [this fine photograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sarlyk_Yak2.jpg) by Alexandr Frolov, whose [user page](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Alexandr_frolov) has a badge to show that he owns a camel. The rest of us are wasting our lives. It's been through a lot of changes, though. (The image, not the camel.) That yak has seen things.

Everything is managed with the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator. 

I'm not (despite a deep love of *Firefly*) in any way affiliated with the SerenityOS people, but I [do like their style](https://yaksplained.org/).
