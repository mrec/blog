*(Note: most of this post has since been subsumed into the [About](@/blog/about/_index.md) page.)*

This blog is a place to put various "notes to self". Partly as a record of things I've found while digging into a topic, partly as a form of [rubberducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) to clarify my thoughts, and partly as a way to exorcise them from my head when, as is generally the case, they were a distraction from whatever I was supposed to be doing. They'll generally be byproducts of the learning process, and so are highly unlikely to contain anything groundbreaking. Initially the subject matter will be mostly [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/), but who knows what else may creep in later.

For anyone confused by the name of the blog, it's a reference to [yak shaving](https://seths.blog/2005/03/dont_shave_that/) with a side allusion to a promotional slogan ("Never Knowingly Undersold") used by a UK retail chain. Yak shaving is very much going to be the theme here; being free to pursue those temptingly hirsute yaks wherever they may roam, razor glinting eagerly in the crisp clean air of the open steppe.

The format is going to be fairly minimalistic; I love the concept of the [quiet web](https://briankoberlein.com/tech/quiet-web/), and my litmus test for quality when reading a webpage is that it doesn't make me want to immediately leap for the "Toggle reader view" button. I do like HTML's newish `<details>` element as a way to capture optional digressions without breaking the flow of the main topic; I think of these as "sub-yaks", fractally budding from the One Universal Mandelyak. Otherwise it'll just be text, bits of code and maybe the occasional pic to break the monotony.

The header image had as its starting point [this fine photograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sarlyk_Yak2.jpg) by Alexandr Frolov, whose [user page](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Alexandr_frolov) has a badge to show that he owns a camel. The rest of us are wasting our lives.

It's been through a lot of changes though. (The image, not the camel.) That yak has seen things.
